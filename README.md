# Stock Signal Predictor

This program uses machine learning to try to predict the future movement of an individual stock. The program uses two years of historcal stock data to train a predictive model. The user inputs their stock ticker and the program outputs a prediction for the user to either buy if the stock is predicted to increase in price or to sell or short it if the price is predicted to fall. The program uses a local web app called "Flask" for a clean and simple user experience.

## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.

The OS, Requests, JSON, Pandas, datetime, hvplot and FinTA libraries were used along with matplotlib and must be installed in order to run the program correctly. Stock data will be pulled from Alpaca so the user will need to install the Alpaca API. The Scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn libraries will have to be installed for machine learning. Flask for Python must be installed in order to enable user input.

OS provides a way to use operating system dependent functionality such as command line operations.

Requests allows the program a simple way to send http requests.

JSON is used for encoding and decoding JSON data in a Python environment.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.

datetime is used to classify specific date and time information, especially when relating to timezones, DST and microsecond timing.

hvpolt is used for visualizing robust and interactive data plots and graphs.

FinTA can be used to run over 80 trading indicators through datasets for analysis.

Matplotlib allows for the visualization of data in the form of plots and graphs.

Scikit-learn implements machine learning and is a simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis. Imbalanced-learn is used along with Scikit-learn to help process imbalanced datasets.

The Alpaca API allows the program to access historical or real-time stock market data.

Flask for Python allows the code to be run behind a clean and simple web app within a virtual environment.

This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The program is a Jupyter Notebook and the user will need to run the program in a code editor such as Juypter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

## Installation Guide

You must install the following libraries and dependencies before running the program.

To install the pathlib, pandas and matplotlib libraries type the following into your CLI:

```
python
-m pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install hvplot
pip install finta
pip install -U matplotlib
pip install alpaca-py
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install -U imbalanced-learn
pip install Flask
```

## Usage

Clone or download the files from the Github repository.

You must create a virtual enviroment in order to use Flask.
Using your CLI, navigate to the directory containing the jupyter notebook file and type the following into your command prompt -

For MacOS / Linux users -
```
mkdir stock_signal_predictor
cd stock_signal_predictor
python3 -m venv venv
```

For Windows users -
```
mkdir stock_signal_predictor
cd stock_signal_predictor
py -3 -m venv venv
```

The virtual environment will then have to be activated. To do this type the following into your command prompt -

For MacOS / Linux users -
```
. venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows users -
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

The final step is to load the Flask app and the notebook file associated with it. Type the following into your command prompt -
```
flask --app app run
```

The program will open in a web browser window with a prompt to enter a stock ticker of the users choice.
Once the user enters their ticker symbol, they press the "Submit" button. The program then returns an output that displays a recommendation based on the prediciton for the user to either purchase or sell / short the stock.
